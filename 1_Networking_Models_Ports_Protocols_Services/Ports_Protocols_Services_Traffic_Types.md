# Connection-Oriented Protocols vs Connectionless Protocols

- Connection-oriented protocols - communication continues until the transmission has been completed and acknowledged
    - Data delivery is guaranteed
    - Higher overhead and greater demand on bandwidth
    - Examples: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)

- Connectionless protocols - communication is sent without establishing a connection, and there is no guarantee of delivery
    - Data delivery is not guaranteed
    - Lower overhead and less demand on bandwidth
    - Examples: User Datagram Protocol (UDP), Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)

# Internet Protocol (IP)
- The protocol used to transport data from one node on a network to another
- IP is a connectionless protocol
- IP also performs fragmentation and reassembly of data packets

- Request for comments (RFC) - standard to describe methods, behaviors, research, or innovations to the operation of the internet and internet-connected systems
    - RFC 791 - Internet Protocol (IP) version 4 (IPv4)
    - RFC 2460 - Internet Protocol (IP) version 6 (IPv6)
