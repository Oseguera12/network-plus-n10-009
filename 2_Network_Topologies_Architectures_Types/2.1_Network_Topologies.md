# Network Topologies
- Topology: A network's physical and logical layout
    - Physical topology: the actual layout of the computer cables and other network devices
    - Logical topology: the way in which the network appears to the devices that use it

- Network topology diagrams: visual representations of network topologies, used to identify network components and how they are physically or logically connected

- Most common topologies:
    - Star/hub and spoke
    - Mesh
    - Hybrid

# Star/Hub and Spoke Topology
- Star topology: all devices are connected to a central hub or switch

    | Pros                          | Cons                    |
    |-------------------------------|-------------------------|
    | easiest to add/remove devices | single point of failure |
    | centralized management        | requires more hardware  |
    | fault isolation               | often expensive         |
    | easy troubleshooting          |                         |

- Each connected device requires a single cable to the hub/switch
    - Network can be expanded without disrupting the entire network
    - A break in any single cable does not cause the entire network to fail

- The most widely used topology in modern networks

# Mesh Topology
- Mesh topology: a network design in which each computer on the network connects to every other, creating a point-to-point connection between every device on the network
    - Wired mesh: all devices are connected physically with cables

    | Pros              | Cons                            |
    |-------------------|---------------------------------|
    | high redundancy   | more cabling makes it expensive |
    | easily expandable | difficult to troubleshoot       |

- Main goal is to provide redundancy and reliability
    - If one connection fails, data can still be transmitted through other connections
    - Can be fully meshed (every device connected to every other) or partially meshed

- Fault tolerance: a process or capability of a network or system to continue working after there is a problem or failure
    - Mesh topology provides higher fault tolerance than other topologies

# Hybrid Topology
- Hybrid topology: a network model that creates a redundant point-to-point network connection between only specific network devices
    - Most commonly used in WAN (Wide Area Network) environments (large networks)
    - Example: two star networks connected by a bus network segment

- Most topologies found in large networking environments are a hybrid of physical topologies

- NOTE: "hybrid topology" is a general term that may be used differently in various contexts, however it will most likely be used to refer to a combination of physical networks for the Network+ exam

# Point-to-Point Topology
- Point-to-point topology: network configuration where two devices or nodes are directly connected to each other
    - Not ideal for larger or more complex networks

- NOTE: This topology is used to connect two devices while star/hub and spoke is used to connect multiple devices to a network

    | Pros                | Cons                  |
